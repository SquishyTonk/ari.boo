                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>There isn't all too much to say. I'm a CompSci major at Victoria University of Wellington. I am a big ol' nerd but unfortunately not the brightest. I am big fan of tinkering with tech so I created this website as a little place to put some of those tinkerings (It is mostly an excuse to get some experience <a href="blog post">web hosting</a>).</p>

            <section id="contact">
                <h1>Contact</h1>
                <p>I'm not sure why you would want to contact me but you can start by flicking me an email over at <a href="mailto:ari@ari.boo">ari@ari.boo</a>.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, I might make my discord server public/create a new public server. Not yet though.</p>
